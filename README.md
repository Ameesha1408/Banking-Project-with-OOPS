# 🏦 Banking Project
## 📌 Overview

This project is a simple Banking System simulation in Python using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.
It demonstrates how different types of bank accounts (Savings and Current) behave when performing operations like deposits, withdrawals, overdrafts, and interest calculations.

The notebook includes practice questions to test concepts like encapsulation, method overriding, and inheritance.

## 🚀 Features

Create SavingsAccount and CurrentAccount objects

Deposit and withdraw money safely

Prevent overdrafts in SavingsAccount

Allow controlled overdrafts in CurrentAccount (up to a limit)

Apply interest to savings accounts

Demonstrates OOP principles:

Encapsulation

Inheritance

Method overriding

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

Python 3

Jupyter Notebook

## 📂 Project Structure
Banking_Project.ipynb   # Main notebook with code and exercises

## 📖 Example Exercises

Create a SavingsAccount for Ravi and deposit 2000.

Try to withdraw 10000 from Sneha’s savings account (only 5000 balance).

Add interest to Arjun’s savings account with 10000 balance.

Create a CurrentAccount for Priya and check overdraft rules.

Attempt to directly access a private variable (__balance) from outside the class.

## ▶️ How to Run

Clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/Banking_Project.git
cd Banking_Project


Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook Banking_Project.ipynb


Run each cell to explore the banking operations.

## 📌 Future Improvements

Add a GUI interface for users

Store account details in a database

Implement transaction history

Add unit tests for validation
